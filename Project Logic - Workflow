1️⃣ Modes of Operation

- Two modes: low resolution and high resolution.
* Currently focus on low resolution.


2️⃣ Data Loading and Background Subtraction

For each energy window:
- Load measurements with gas target (M_i) and background measurements (B_i).
- Compute total measurements (M_tot) and total background (B_tot), then compute backround substracted spectra (F_tot = M_tot - B_tot)
- BONUS: Check consistency of measurements and backgrounds for each energy window -> If any measurement deviates by > 20% from the others → raise error/warning.
- Translate counts to DDCS and # channels to electron energy


3️⃣ Data Selection / Cropping

- Each energy window has 256 points. Allow the user to select which portion of the data to plot: Crop from beginning / end (independently for each window)
    * Could be implemented with start_index and end_index for each window / Maybe do it live with scroll bars in the plot (?)


4️⃣ Plotting Results

- Plot Ftot for each energy window.
- Provide options to the user:
    1) Save figure as image
    2) Save data as text file


5️⃣ Data Averaging

- Allow averaging over N points, where N is user-defined.
* Multiple N values can be used for different energy ranges.


~ Basic functions ~

1) load_data() → load measurement and background files
2) check_consistency() → check for >20% deviations
3) Final() → compute Ftot
4) DDCS() → translate counts to DDCS
5) Ecal()  → translate channels to electron energy 
6) crop_data() → crop each window according to user selection
7) average_data() → perform N-point averaging
8) plot_results() → plot and save images/data
