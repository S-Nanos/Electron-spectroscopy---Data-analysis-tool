## Workflow Guidelines

### 1. Work on Personal Branches
- Each team member works in their own branch without affecting `main`.
- Treat it as a **logbook**: leave short update messages or commit notes describing your progress, or changes.
- Push changes regularly to Github so the log is visible to the team.

### 2. Team Meetings
- During team meetings, review updates from personal branches.
- Discuss which changes should be included in `main`.
- Resolve any questions, issues, or conflicts before merging.

### 3. Updating `main`
- Once changes are approved, merge them into `main`.
- Ensure `main` always remains **stable and functional**.
- After merging, all team members should pull the latest `main` into their personal branches
